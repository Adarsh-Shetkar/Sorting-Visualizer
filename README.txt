We have learnt sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, quick sort. But often 
we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to 
visualize how they work. This project sorting visualizer is a very simple UI and it allows the users to 
select the sort algorithm, select the array size, and speed of the visualization.

So, the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. We will be 
creating a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize how various sorting 
algorithms work. And Implementation of animations, effects and core fundamentals (sorting 
algorithms) using JavaScript. The sorting Algorithms we will be focusing upon while doing this 
project are Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort and Quick Sort. This will help
us to understand how these algorithms work.
