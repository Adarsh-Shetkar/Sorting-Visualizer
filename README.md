## Abstract

Animation is a compelling medium for the display of program behavior. Since programs are 
inherently temporal, executing through time, they can be vividly represented by an animated display 
which portrays how they carry out their processing and how their essential state changes over time. 
Furthermore, many algorithms employ repetitive computations, whether expressed iteratively or 
recursively. These can be viewed efficiently when displayed as a motion picture. In so doing, we can 
perceive structure and relationships of causality, and ultimately infer what the program is doing. 
Software visualization can therefore be a powerful tool for presenting computer science concepts 
and assisting students as they struggle to comprehend them.
